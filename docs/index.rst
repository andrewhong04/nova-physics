Nova Physics is a lightweight rigid body physics engine. It is created with game development in mind but you can use it anywhere you need to simulate rigid body dynamics. It is written in portable C with no dependencies other than the standard library.

Nova Physics tries to give satisfying results with the developer having control over the simulation, creating realistic and accurate results within real-time performance.
