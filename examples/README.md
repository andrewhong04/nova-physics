# Welcome to Nova Physics Example Demos üëã
To build & run examples use Nova Physics's build system `nova_builder.py` Python script.

## Windows
Dependencies will be installed by the script.

Set working directory as the Nova Physics directory.
```
cd "C:\...\nova-physics"
```

Then run the build system, it will detect the missing dependencies and install them on the fly.
```
python nova_builder.py example <example_name>
```

## Linux
You have to install SDL2 and TTF extension via your package manager or build it yourself.

Here are two sources explaining how to install SDL2 on Linux
- https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation
- https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/linux/index.php

After installing the dependencies, set working directory as Nova Physics directory.
```
cd ./.../nova-physics
```
Then run the build system. (It can be `py` or `python3` depending on the platform.)
```
python nova_builder.py example <example_name>
```
