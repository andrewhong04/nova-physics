Nova Physics is a lightweight and easy to use 2D physics engine.
</p>



# Features
- Simple and user-friendly interface
- Rigid body dynamics
- Iterative sequential impulse solver
- Semi-implicit (symplectic) Euler integrator
- Convex polygon, circle and AABB collisions
- Material properties (friction, restitution and density)
- Collision event callbacks
- Sleeping
- Attractive forces
- Portable codebase with no dependencies



# Future
Nova Physics is still in its early stages as in 0.x.x versions. There is a large room of improvement and optimization of the API and engine's itself. Here are some important points that needs a touch before reaching 1.x.x milestone:

#### Faster broad-phase with Spatial Hashing or Bounding Volume Hierarchy
Current broad-phase strategy is to check AABB collisions between every bodies to narrow down expensive polygon checks. But this aproach is still **far away** from efficient, we are checking every body with each one. That's why the current algorithm needs to be changed in order to have a reasonable performance with _looots_ of bodies simulating.

#### Stability & Stacking
Other than a faster broad-phase, I will be working on simulation stability and general optimization. Methods like accumulating impulses accross frames and warm-starting cached impulses are one of the methods. ([Erin Catto has amazing slides about these topics from GDC](https://box2d.org/files/ErinCatto_SequentialImpulses_GDC2006.pdf))

#### Codebase & Structure
Improve the codebase. Doing so with better docs and all will help me and contributors on the long run.

#### Python Binding
Nova Physics's Python module ([here](https://github.com/kadir014/nova-physics/blob/main/python-binding/)) is still WIP. I plan it to have an easy-to-use Pythonic interface. I might create a new repository for it instead.



# Installing & Building
Nova Phyiscs is lightweight and portable, using only C standard library.
<br><br>
Development libraries are always shipped with the most recent release under the name of `nova-physics-X.X.X-devel.zip` or `.tar.gz`. You can download the archive [here](https://github.com/kadir014/nova-physics/releases) and link `libnova.a` to use Nova Physics in your project.
<br><br>
But if you want (*or need*) to build Nova Physics from scratch on your own, use [the building guide](https://github.com/kadir014/nova-physics/blob/main/BUILDING.md#building-nova-physics-library).



# Examples
